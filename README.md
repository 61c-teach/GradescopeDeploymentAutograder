# GradescopeDeploymentAutograder
This is mean to be a base autograder which will clone the normal autograder from the CS61C Teach Repo.

To use this, first generate the deploy keys with the `gen_deploy_keys.sh` script.
Next add the deploy_key to the repo which you want to load and give it ONLY read access.
Finally upload this autograder.
